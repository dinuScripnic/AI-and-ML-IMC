## Instructions
* Load the Dry_Bean dataset (attached) and:
Perform a short Explorative Data Analysis (EDA)
Create a feed-forward neural network to predict the class of the beans by using the other variables as predictors
Split the data in train and test (with ratio 80-20)
Convert to tensors
Experiment with different number of layers and nodes, different learning rates, different optimizers, etc.
Show results on training and test set
